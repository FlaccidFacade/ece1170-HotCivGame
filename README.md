# ece1170-HotCivGame
A Java HotCiv project created using Test Driven Development. This project losely follows the book: Flexible, Reliable, Software (https://www.baerbak.com/). 
The project contains different usable versions defined by alphaciv, betaciv and so on.
Each version is a practice in implementing different software principles, techniques, and patterns.

This project also taught me about advance features of versioning through git and how to leverage them in development.

This project is forked from my school account.
